<div><p>We protect your privacy. We only save data that we need to remember who you are and contact you.</p></div>
<div>During registration we ask you for information that only you would know. We relay this information to a third-party commercial Identity Service Provider (IDSP). They use it to assure us that you really are who you claim to be, and then they throw it away. Some of this information is voluntary, but sharing it makes it more likely we can assure your identity. If we cannot confirm your identity, then we cannot give you access.</div>
